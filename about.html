			<p>Working in tech has always been a dream of mine—before that, I wanted to be a pastry chef. I love the creativity and problem-solving that come with software engineering, as well as the constant opportunity to learn new technologies and tackle challenging bugs.</p>  

			<p>I have four years of professional experience as a Software Engineer, specializing in front-end and full-stack development. I’ve worked at Infosys and Radancy, where I’ve built scalable web applications, optimized user experiences, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful software solutions.</p>  

			<p>I graduated from the University of California, Riverside, with a degree in Sociology and Computer Science. During college, I was involved in ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and SWE (Society of Women Engineers) and volunteered with STEM-focused organizations like Girls Who Code.</p>  

			<p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, watching movies, and spending quality time with family and friends. I also love baking desserts whenever I get the chance or diving into a good non-fiction book.</p>
